# EnhanceDiskUtility
SIMBL plugin for Disk Utility that aims to enable Verify / Repair Permissions support

# Installation!

Installation is fairly easy if you have mySIMBL installed! [mySIMBL Repository](https://github.com/w0lfschild/mySIMBL)

Just download the project, open it in Xcode, compile and find the EnhanceDiskUtility.bundle in Finder!
Then double-click it and it will be installed to mySIMBL. Just make sure it has a green light which means its enabled!

# Status

At this state the plugin loads, adds two buttons on the Disk Utility Toolbar! The project is nearly ready, the only thing missing is the actual utility or code to verify/repair permissions.

I would like to use FireWolf's utility [FireWolf's Website](https://www.firewolf.science/2016/07/repairpermissions-v3-now-supports-repairing-permissions-on-macos-sierra/)
but I havent yet made it work... ( It is written by him, and supports many more features such as multicore repair / verification thus allows faster processing of files than apple's repair_packages utility! )

I leave the project as is because I dont have much time right now...
