# Installation!

Installation is fairly easy if you have mySIMBL installed! [mySIMBL Repository](https://github.com/w0lfschild/mySIMBL)

Just download the project, open it in Xcode, compile and find the EnhanceDiskUtility.bundle in Finder!
Then double-click it and it will be installed to mySIMBL. Just make sure it has a green light which means its enabled!

At this state the plugin loads, adds two buttons on the Disk Utility Toolbar! The project is nearly ready, the only thing missing is some more code make use of the RepairPermissionsUtility embedded into the bundle.
