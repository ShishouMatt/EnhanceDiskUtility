# EnhanceDiskUtility
SIMBL plugin for Disk Utility that aims to enable Verify / Repair Permissions support

This project uses FireWolf's Utility for Repairing Permissions: [FireWolf's Website](https://www.firewolf.science/2016/07/repairpermissions-v3-now-supports-repairing-permissions-on-macos-sierra/)

# Installation!

Installation is fairly easy if you have mySIMBL installed! [mySIMBL Repository](https://github.com/w0lfschild/mySIMBL)

Just download the project, open it in Xcode, compile and find the EnhanceDiskUtility.bundle in Finder!
Then double-click it and it will be installed to mySIMBL. Just make sure it has a green light which means its enabled!

***NOTE:*** You will NEED to sign both the SMJobBlessHelper project, the SMJobBlessHelperCaller project and the EnhanceDiskUtility bundle project with your Developer ID.  The software CANT work without it!  I am really sorry for the inconvenience but I don't have a developer ID at this moment.
